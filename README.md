*DOMAIN* : C PROGRAMMING
*DURATION*: 6WEEK
*MENTOR*: NEELA SANTOSH
*TASK DISCRIPITION*
Create a C program that implements a basic data compression algorithm — specifically Run-Length Encoding (RLE) — to compress and decompress text files.
RLE is a simple lossless compression method where sequences of the same data value are stored as a single value and count.
*tools and technologies*
Component	             -              Description
Programming Language	  -              C/C++ (compatible with Turbo C++)
Compiler                -           	Turbo C++ IDE with Borland C++ Compiler
IDE	Turbo                -           C++ (DOS-based or Windows emulator version)
Platform                -       	DOS/Windows via Turbo C++ environment
*platform*
This project is designed to be executed in the Turbo C++ IDE, which typically runs in DOSBox or on older Windows systems. All operations (input/output) are performed via console using stdio.h.
*application*
Data Archiving -	Compressing text logs, configuration files, and documents to save space.
Embedded Systems	-Useful where memory is limited and quick encoding/decoding is needed
